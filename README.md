# html-css-2-lab-exercise

Your lab exercise today is to clone the layout of the SpaceX website: https://www.spacex.com/

Your objective is to clone the LAYOUT, don't worry about using the exact images, adding animations (we'll cover that later), and what the website looks like
on different screen sizes. Focus on the layout of elements, and utilize what you learned about flexbox and the position properties to help you out. Good luck!
